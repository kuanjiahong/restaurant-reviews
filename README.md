### VIDEO DEMO: https://youtu.be/SyTaLr_E4SU

### Description: 
This is a website that allow the user to view, add, edit and delete restaurant reviews. 

When adding a restaurant, the user is required to provide the restaurant's name, cuisine style and give a rating to it. Afterwards, the user will be able to view the restaurant at the homepage. If the user feels like editing the restaurant (be it that the user has made a typo or that the user feels the rating is not accurate), the user can edit their reviews by clicking the "Edit" button. Lastly, the user can also delete the restaurant they have typed in should they feel like it. In summary, this is a website that allows the user to carry out Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operation.


To use this website for personal use, ensure that you have a MongoDB Atlas account and refer to this tutorial on how to connect your application to your database. Bear in mind that this repository do not have a `.env.local` file so it is up to the user to create the file yourself.

This website is created using Nextjs and Mongodb

This website is based on the reference below

[Build Nextjs with mongodb and deploy on vercel](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/build-nextjs-with-mongodb-and-deploy-on-vercel/#installing-nextjs)

[MongoDB Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/getting-started/)

#

And below here is for Next.js framework

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
